# Build
The `acs-packaging` project uses _GitHub Actions_. \
The workflow files can be found under path `.github/workflows`.


## Stages
Although a little unusual, builds branches other than `master` and `release/...` are preceded by
cloning and building branches with the same name in upstream projects: `alfresco-community-repo` and
`alfresco-enterprise-repo`. This is done so that development can take place in parallel between projects
without having to do development releases to link them together. In fact, you don't even have to wait for
the upstream GitHub Actions build to complete. You just need to make sure the parent poms reference
each other and the `dependency.alfresco-community-repo.version` and
`dependency.alfresco-enterprise-repo.version` in the pom.xml files use the same SNAPSHOT values.

1. **test**: Java build with unit tests, integration tests and WhiteSource scan.
2. **docker_latest**: creates `latest` tags of `alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-aws`
   and `alfresco/alfresco-content-repository`.
   Also creates `${acs.version}-${build-number}` tags (e.g. `7.0.0-9876`) for the single pipeline images.
3. **release**: On release and master branches, where the commit message includes `[release]`, this stage
   creates `${project.version}` tags (e.g. `7.0.0`, `7.0.0-A20`) of `alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-aws`
   and `alfresco/alfresco-content-repository`. These are in addition to the tags created in the *docker-latest* stage.
3. **publish**: On release and master branches, where the commit message includes `[publish]`, this stage
   copies artifacts to the AWS Release bucket for access by customers.
