/**
 * Evaluates whether the Cut Node action should be visible.
 *
 * Among all available operations over non-multilingual documents (i.e. copy,
 * delete, start discussion, etc), there is a missing one: <b>Move</b>.
 * Translations cannot be moved due to the exiting link it has with the logical
 * document. Despite it is technically achievable, it could be functionally
 * troublesome. Spreading translations of the same semantic message among several
 * spaces could lead to confusion and problems.
 *
 * If the node to move is a mlContainer, the user must have enough right to delete each translation
